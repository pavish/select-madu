Pull requests are encouraged and always welcome. Help make SelectMadu better!

To work on SelectMadu
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavish/select-madu.git
cd select-madu
npm install
```

The component is written in [Svelte][svelte-url]. 
It's an awesome library, you should check it out!

SCSS is used for styling. It is separate from the component and is within styles folder.  

To build, run
```bash
npm run build
```

Build generates the dist folder which contains the es and umd variants for importing using npm.
The bundle folder is also generated which contains the iife variant with and without minimization.

You can also contribute by writing additional tests, adding issues that you encounter, or by helping with the documentation.
