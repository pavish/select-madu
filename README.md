<SelectMadu/>
```


### Basic usage
```javascript
  //To create
  let instance = new SelectMadu({
     <!-- SelectMadu dom elements will be rendered within the specified parent element in target. -->
    target: document.querySelector("#parentElement"),

    <!-- Properties for initializing SelectMadu. Refer Properties info below. -->
    props: {
      datasource: [
        { text: "Ferrai" }, 
        { text: "Volkswagen group", children: [{ text: "Audi" }, { text: "Lamborghini" } ] },
        { text: "BMW" }
      ]
    }
